                    Exactus offers software selection services that are predicated on the needs of the client in lieu of
                    previously established interlocking directorates. Many of our competitors have established
                    relationships with technology providers that impede their ability to provide a true objective
                    analysis and recommendation. At Exactus we are objective to technology. Exactus has established
                    relationships with dozens of real estate technology providers, and our decision to recommend
                    technology is always based on the needs of the client.
