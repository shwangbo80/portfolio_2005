                    Exactus’ business process review services are designed to provide us with a comprehensive
                    understanding of the existing processes of a client prior to making a technology or process
                    recommendation. We believe that there are inherent advantages to operational efficiency and
                    processes with a change in technology, and that those advantages can only be fully understood with a
                    comprehension of the existing operations. The principals of Exactus have excelled in identifying
                    operational process savings above and beyond the traditional reduction of operating expense payments
                    to landlords.
